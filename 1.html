when you came home i wrote a song <br />
i never showed anyone <br />
i still remember the hook it went <br />
'i'm getting clean for you' <br />
because i wanted to get clean again <br />
and i knew that if i did we could be happy <br />
we did it once before <br />
i thought we could do it again <br />
<br /><br />
i wanted to say i'm sorry <br />
i never got clean for you <br />
like i wanted to do so badly <br />
and everything i knew i forgot <br />
i will shed this stupid body <br />
i will grow tall and be someone new <br />
when i do you can come find me <br />
but until then i'll be missing for a while

<br />
